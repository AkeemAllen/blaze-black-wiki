## Summary
Pokémon Blaze Black is an edit of the regular Pokémon Black version which self-contains all 649 Pokémon, allowing a player a large amount of variety. In addition, BB also has edited trainers, an increased difficulty level, improvements to many Pokémon and more. They are the spiritual successor of my two other hacks, Pokémon Fire Red Omega and Pokémon Spirit Gold. Blaze Black was also - with one minor exception - the first of their kind to be made.
